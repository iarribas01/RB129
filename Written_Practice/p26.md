How do class inheritance and mixing in modules affect instance variable scope? Give an example.

Class inheritance extends the scope of instance variables so that all subclasses have access to instance variables of its parent class.

For example, given the code:

```ruby
class Pet
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Dog < Pet
end
```

Due to inheritance, if we instantiate a `Dog` object, we can access the `@name` variable because the scope of `@name` has just been extended to `Dog` objects as well.

Instance variable scope *also* extends when mixing in modules. When using mixins, now instance variables defined in an object are accessible to the module that is included in the class, and instance variables initialized in the module are accessible to the class.
