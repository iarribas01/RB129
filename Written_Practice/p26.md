How do class inheritance and mixing in modules affect instance variable scope? Give an example.

Class inheritance and mixing in modules extends the scope of instance variables, but only for instance variables initialized in parent classes or in modules.

For example, if we have the instance variable `@name` initialized inside the `Pet` object and we create a `Dog` object that inherits from `Pet`, the scope of `@name` has just been extended to `Dog` objects as well.

Something similar happens with modules. Say we initialize an instance variable `@can_swim` in a method called `enable_swimming`. Say we include this module in our `Dog` class. Now, our `Dog` object can access this `@can_swim` instance variable. The only caveat is that the instance variable isn't initialized until we call `enable_swimming`.

However, the instance variable scope is not extended when we do the reverse. So, if we an instance variable initialized in a subclass, we cannot access this from a parent class. Modules, however, can still access instance variables from a class.
