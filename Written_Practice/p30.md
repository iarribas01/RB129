When does accidental method overriding occur, and why? Give an example.

Accidental method overriding occurs when we unintentionally override a method from a parent class. This tends to occur when there is name collision and we want to create a method with the same name as a method already defined in a parent class.

For example, we want to create a `Letter` class and define a method called `send`. The name of the method `send` would make perfect sense given this context, given that we want to *send* a *letter*. However, this would likely be  a case of accidental method overriding because there is already a `send` method defined in the `Object` class. We most likely don't want to overwrite any potentially useful methods.
