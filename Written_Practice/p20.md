The difference between states and behaviors is what lies in their purpose and capabilities.

The purpose of a state is to store data for a particular object. Instance and class variables are examples of states.

The purpose of a behavior is to do some calculation or action, sometimes with the data stored for the object. Methods are examples of behaviors.
