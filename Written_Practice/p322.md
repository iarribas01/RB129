## What is polymorphism and how can we implement polymorphism in Ruby? Provide examples.

Polymorphism is the ability of various objects to respond to a common interface. We can implement polymorphism in two ways: inheritance or duck typing.

Inheritance allows all instances of a child class to respond to the same method call if we decide to implement a method of the same name inside the child class or write a method in the parent class. For example, we can have three extremely different `Animal` objects: `Fish`, `Bird`, and `Rodent`, and they can all inherit from the `Animal` but still be able to `eat` in their own way.

Duck typing is where we would define a common method in completely unrelated classes. So rather than inheriting from the `Animal` class and just overriding the `eat` method, we can define an `eat` method in each of the classes `Fish`, `Bird`, and `Rodent` and not inherit from the `Animal` class at all. This gives us the same result with a different structure: all can still `eat` while being completely unrelated.
