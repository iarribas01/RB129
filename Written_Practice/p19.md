What is the `attr_accessor` method, and why wouldnâ€™t we want to just add `attr_accessor` methods for every instance variable in our class? Give an example.


The `attr_accessor` method is a shorthand way of creating both a getter method and a setter method for the name of the instance variable specified.

We don't always want to add `attr_accessor` because it is good practice to enable users to only have abilities they *need*. If users are granted access to, say, change the grade point average of a particular student, we can assume that all students are able to change their own GPA at any time. This would compromise the whole grading system.

This is a case where we need to preserve our data, and grant students only read access, not write access--which `attr_accessor` permits.
