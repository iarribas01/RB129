The output is `bark! bark!   bark! bark!`

The problem comes from our constructor on line 8.

We are instantiating a new `Dog` object and passing in `"Teddy"` as an argument. Ruby looks for (and finds) an `initialize` method for the `Dog` class and uses this one to build the object. We have overridden the constructor from the parent class, so `Animal#initialize` method is ignored and the `Dog#initialize` method is used instead. However, on line 8, we take the argument and do nothing with it, so the instance variable `@name` still has a value of `nil`. 

When we try to output the value of `@name`, we see nothing.

This demonstrates how instance variables, even if they are not initialized, will automatically have a value of `nil` and how overridden methods will be invoked rather than methods of the same name defined in the parent class.
