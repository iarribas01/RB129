The method lookup path is `GoodAnimals::GoodDog` > `Danceable`> `Swimmable`> `Animal`> `Walkable`> `Object`> `Kernel`> `BasicObject`. 

This structure is namespaced inside `GoodAnimals`. Elements included or classes defined in `GoodAnimals` does not affect the lookup path for `GoodDog`, the class we are concerned about.

The lookup path starts in `GoodDog` and then it will search modules included in it from the bottom up, which is why `Danceable` is searched before `Swimmable`.

Then, we move to the parent class `Animal` and repeat the process again with our module `Walkable`.
