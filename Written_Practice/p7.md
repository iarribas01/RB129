The following outputs 4 and then 2 (five times).

The 4 is printed due to the output statement on line 9. We are printing the class variable `wheels` whose value is set to 4 at the time of this print statement. When we get to line 12 and define our `Motorcycle` class inheriting from `Vehicle`, we are actually reassining the value of the same class variable `wheels` from earlier and now assigning it to the value 2. This explains why the rest of the print statements of the class variable `wheels` is 2.

This demonstrates how class variables in an inheritance hierarchy are shared with sub classes as well. It is better to avoid using class variables when working with inheritance in order to avoid unintended changes such as this one.
