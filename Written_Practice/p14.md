The reason line 11 returns false is because we are using the default implementation of the `==` method from the `Object` class. In this case, we want to change how `==` works. In order to get line 11 to change its output to true, we must override the `==` method and define one in the `Person` class, specifically comparing the values of instance variable `@name`.

The code `al.name == alex.name` does not necessarily mean that the two string objects are the same. In fact, the `String` class has its own `==` method that checks if the contents are the same, not that they are the same object. If we want to check if two strings are the same object, we can compare object ID's, or we can call the `equal?` method on the string and pass in the string we want to compare.

**5:45, Good but not 100% sure on my answer. Need to review equality.**
