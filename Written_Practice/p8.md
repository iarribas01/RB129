This outputs the class and object encoding ID of the object that `bruno` is pointing to, along with the values stored in instance variables `name` and `color` (both values happen to be set to string `"brown"`)

This happens because of the way we implemented our constructor. On line 11, we are calling `super`, which passes `color` into the parent constructor. `Animal`'s constructor expects a value to represent the *name* of the animal, not a color.

Therefore, the instance variable `name` is set to whatever was passed in as a color, which is why `name` *and* `color` are set to `"brown"`.

This demonstrates how `super` will automatically pass in any arguments passed in to its parent class method.
