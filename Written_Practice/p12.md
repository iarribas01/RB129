We get a `NoMethodError` for undefined method `jump` on line 28.

This happens because on line 28, we invoke the getter method `Person#pets` on the object that `bob` is pointing to. This returns an array of pets. However, we immediately chain the method `jump` to this array, but the `Array` class does not contain a `jump` method. This is why the error is thrown.

We want to call `Pet#jump` on *each* of `bob`'s pets, not on the entire collection. We can change line 28 to `bob.pets.each {|p| p.jump}`.

`kitty` and `bud` are collaborator objects of `bob` because they are objects stored in a `Person` object's state.
