We would implement a fake operator for a class where it would be intuitive for the user to use these operators for the particular object.

For example, say we have a `Team` class that stores an array of `Player`s. It would make sense to implement a `Team#+` method because we can assume that this method returns a new `Team` object that contains the elements of two `Team`s combined. This makes the code readable for users so that they can use the method like so:

`red_team + blue_team`

It would be bad to implement the fake operators when it doesn't make sense, such as implementing it in the `Player`. We don't know what a `+` method could do to two `Player` objects, combine the name? combine the age? This is why it is important to get a sense for the context and only implement fake operators when it seems right.
