Line 16 throws an error because of how line 9 attemps variable reassignment. Here, `name` on line 9 refers to a local variable and is attempting to do variable reassignment and set its value equal to whatever is on the right side of the `=` sign. As Ruby tries to evaluate the value of the right side, variable shadowing occurs and `name` refers to the local variable that is trying to be assigned, not the getter method `name` for the `Person` object. 

We can fix this code by changing line 9 to `self.name = name.upcase`. This demonstrates how Ruby requires `self` to be prepended to instance variable reassignment so that it can disambiguate between local and instance variable reassignment.
