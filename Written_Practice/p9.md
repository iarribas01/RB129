This code throws an `ArugmentError` saying that our `initialize` method expects 0 arguments but gets 1. 

The problems starts on line 8 where we are calling `super`, which tells Ruby to look for an `initialize` method in the `Animal` class that takes 1 argument so that we can pass in color. However, our `Animal#initialize` method takes zero arguments only.

We can fix this by either changing line 8 to `super()` or deleting that line all together.

This demonstrates how there is a key distinction between `super` and `super()`. `super` passes in the arguments from the method in which it is called in, to the parent method. `super()` explicitly passes in zero arguments to its parent method.
