The above code demonstrates that instance variables are scoped at the object level. They do not cross over to other objects and are accessible to the particular object they belong to.

Here, we have two `Person` objects that store `@name` as one of their states. The code proves that we have two different objects with different ID's that keep their `@name` instance variable values separate from each other. This is why we see a different value stored for `@name` for each of the `Person` objects.
