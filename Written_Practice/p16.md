 Why is it generally safer to invoke a setter method (if available) vs. referencing the instance variable directly when trying to set an instance variable within the class? Give an example.

A setter method is considered "safe" because setter method's can prevent outside users from directly accessing and manipulating raw data. Setter methods can also implement some protection against errors or invalid changes.

For example, a setter method could be in place to change the instance variable of the balance in a Bank account. The `balance` instance variable must have some precautions in place to prevent users from improperly changing their balance, such as withdrawing more than they own or depositing an extremely high number (to protect against fraud.)
