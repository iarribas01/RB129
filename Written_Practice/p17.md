Give an example of when it would make sense to manually write a custom getter method vs. using `attr_reader`.


Manually writing a custom getter would be appropriate for a situation where protecting the data is needed. For example, protecting all digits of a SSN would be a situation where we want to hide all digits except the last four. This would require returning a different value from what is actually stored in the instance variable.
