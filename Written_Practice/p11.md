The output is:
```
  I eat.
  I eat plankton.
  I eat kibble.
```

This is the output because we are iterating through an array that contains `Animal`, `Fish`, and `Dog` objects and invoking `Animal#eat` on all of the objects. Each produce a different output unique to their object type because this method is overridden in the subclasses.

This code demonstrates polymorphism and how all objects inheriting from a parent class are able to respond to a common interface. Here, `Fish` and `Dog` are able to respond to the `Animal#eat` method despite having slightly different behaviors.
