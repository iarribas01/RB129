How is Method Access Control implemented in Ruby? 
Provide examples of when we would use public,
protected, and private access modifiers.

Method access control can be implemented to change the accessibility of methods with the keywords `public`, `protected`, and `private`. We can simply use any of these keywords within our class on a single line and place any method that we want to change the accessibility of underneath this line.

We would use `private` for methods where we want the most protection, usually to keep data only accessible to the instance of `self`. For example, if we want to create a `BankAccount`, we will most likely store some private information, such as the password, and we would set the getter method of the `password` as private, since we don't really need the user to be able to read the password, we only want the user to be able to check if they're putting in the right password.

`protected` is for sharing data between members of `self` only. A good use for a `protected` method would be to compare two `credit_score` as this will not be needed to the public.

All methods are automatically `public` unless specified otherwise. We should always make the fewest methods public as possible because this will prevent outside users from manipulating data.
