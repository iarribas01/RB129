What are the use cases for `self` in Ruby, and how does `self` change based on the scope it is used in? Provide examples.
----------

`self` is used when we want to explicitly call a particular method or make a reference to the method caller.

We must use `self` when we want to disambiguate between a setter method and creating an instance variable. Ex) we want to change the value of a `@name` instance variable, we must use `self.name = new_name`, we can't just used `name = new_name`.

We also use `self` when we want to make a reference to the current caller. For example, in class methods, we can use `self` within the body to make a reference to the current class. Here, `Person::what_am_i` will return `Person`, and `Person#who_am_i` will return the object that is calling the method.

```ruby
class Person
  # code ommitted for brevity....
  def self.what_am_i
    self
  end
  
  def who_am_i
    self
  end
end
```
