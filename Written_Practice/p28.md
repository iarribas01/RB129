<!-- What is output and why? How could we output a message of our choice instead? -->

When we `puts sparky`, we probably expect to see something meaningful; perhaps, the name of the `GoodDog` object. We instead see the object encoding ID and class name of the `GoodDog` object that `sparky` is pointing to: `#<GoodDog:0x000000000164b288>`. 

The reason this happens is because we are passing in a `GoodDog` object into the `puts` method which automatically calls the object's `to_s` method. Our `GoodDog` object uses the default `to_s` method from its parent class: the `Object` class, where a `to_s` method *is* defined and gives us the output we see here.

If we want to print something meaninful, we need to *override* the `to_s` method by defining one in our custom `GoodDog` class.
