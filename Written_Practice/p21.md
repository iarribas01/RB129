There is also a difference in the way the method header is written. Class methods are prepended with self, ex) `self.total_dogs` and instance methdos are not, ex) `eat`

They also differ by changing the meaning of `self` inside their method body. `self` refers to the *class* inside class methods, and `self` refers to the *object* inside instance variables.

Lastly, they are called in different ways. Class methods are invoked upon a class `Dog.total_dogs` whereas instance methods require an instance of an object to be invoked ex) `Dog.new.eat`
