What are collaborator objects, and what is the purpose of using them in OOP? Give an example of how we would work with one.

Collaborator objects are objects stored as a state within another object. Their purpose is to allow us to represent "has-a" relationships in OOP. For example, say we want to create an object `Owner` that *has-a* `Pet`. In this case, we would make an instance variable `@pet` and store a `Pet` object in the `Owner`'s state, making this `Pet` object a collaborator object of `Owner`. This structure makes it easy to represent real-world relationships.
