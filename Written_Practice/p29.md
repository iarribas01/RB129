The output is slightly different.

Now, we are not only seeing the class encoding ID and class name from earlier: `#<GoodDog:0x0000000001f73310>`
We are also seeing the instance variables along with this string of text: `#<GoodDog:0x0000000001f73310 @name="Sparky", @age=28>`.

This happens because now, we are calling the `p` method rather than the `puts` method. The `p` method automatically calls `inspect` rather than `to_s`. `inspect` exposes the instance variables of a particular object.
