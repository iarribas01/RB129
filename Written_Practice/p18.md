Executing `Triangle.sides` will return `nil` because we are calling the class method `Triangle::sides`. This class method isn't found, but is found in its parent `Shape`, so `Shape::sides` is called. This returns the value of the class variable `sides` which was initialized to `nil` on line 2. 

However, executing `Triangle.new.sides` will return `3` because calling `Triangle.new` will invoke the constructor. Inside our custom constructor for the `Triangle` class, we reassign the value of the class variable `sides` to `3` on line 15. This is why `3` is the output, rather than `nil`.

This demonstrates how class variables are a single copy that is shared amongst all of its sub classes and can likewise be mutated by all sub classes.
