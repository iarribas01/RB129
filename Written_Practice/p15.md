Lines 14, 15, and 16 output:

```
  Bob
  My name is BOB.
  BOB
```

Line 14 outputs the value of the instance variable `@name` which happens to be`Bob`. We set the instance variables value during instantiation from line 13.

Line 15 outputs `My name is BOB.` because we are passing in a `Person` object to the `puts` method call. The `#puts` method automatically calls `to_s` on the arugment that is passed in. We've overridden the `to_s` method and made a custom one and the particular output is displayed here.

Line 16 displays the new value that the instance variable `@name` is, which is `BOB`. This is because we called a destructive method `#upcase!` on our instance variable `@name` when we called the `to_s` method earlier.

This code demonstrates how instance variables can store data and be manipulated throughout the program.
