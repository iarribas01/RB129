3. (human_2) is there a mistake in the code? How can you produce annagilles without changing the state of the objects??
4. (barbarian) --- good to practice talking through the code, doesn't actually need reworking though.
5. (monster) is this the correct form of duck typing?
6. (classes) how can you not add any methods? does overriding a method count as adding a method?
