=begin 
Define a class of your choice with the following:

  + Constructor method that initializes 2 instance variables.
  + Instance method that outputs an interpolated string of those variables.
  + Getter methods for both (you can use the shorthand notation if you want).
  + Prevent instances from accessing these methods outside of the class.

  Finally, explain what concept(s) youâ€™ve just demonstrated with your code.
