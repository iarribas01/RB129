The following code 
```ruby
module Greet
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Teacher
  include Greet
end

class Student
  include Greet
end

tom = Teacher.new
rob = Student.new

tom.greet "Bonjour!"
rob.greet "Hello!"
```

demonstrates the use of mixins. Here, we have two custom classes defined where both classes are not related to each other (they are not on the same branch of an inheritance chain).

We are able to `include` a module of our choice into the classes that we want to have these behaviors. This gives the classes the behaviors contained in the module. 

We are simply able to call the `greet` method because the module `Greet` was included into the two different classes that our instances are calling.
