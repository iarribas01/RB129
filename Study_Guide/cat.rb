# What is wrong with the code above? Why? What principle about getter/setter methods does this demonstrate?

# In the imethod `rename`, we need to prepend `self` to `name` on line 9, otherwise Ruby assumes weâ€™re initializing a new local variable `name` and assigning it to the argument passed in through the parameter `name`.
